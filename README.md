### App Description
An app that helps locate restraunts depending on the users mood/cravings and location.

### App Idea Evaluation

- Mobile: An app that helps you efficently pack your car when traveling.
- Story:
- Market: Those that drive long distances and need help with sorting their luggage while leaving space for comfort
- Habit: The app can become addicting because travelng stinks but with this app packing won’t be a hassle anymore. Figuring out how much room you have in your car will allow to travel more efficently
- Scope: App shouldn’t be difficult and a stripped down version would still be helpful. Put some info about a specific car and the app will tell how much room you have
